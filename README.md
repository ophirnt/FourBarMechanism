# FourBarMechanism
Four Bar Mechanism Solver. Calculates angular position, velocities, accelerations, nodal positions, 
and anything else that is possible. Comes with an example code to produce plots and animations of said mechanism. 
Made in a few days during my Machine Dynamics classes, as a side-project. 
Any doubt, feedback or commentary, please open an issue or contact me: I'd be really happy to hear!!
